## üåü Introduction

This project predicts stock prices based on historical data and includes analysis of stock trends across sectors. By leveraging deep learning techniques, such as LSTMs, the model predicts **Open**, **High**, **Low**, and **Close** values for selected stocks or indices. 

The goal is to provide accurate insights for investors and researchers.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Load and prepare your stock data (e.g., `.csv` files with OHLC data).
2. Open the `Stock_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess data, train the LSTM model, and visualize predictions.
4. Use the Flask API to fetch real-time stock data:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
5. Refer to the [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/31842216/2sAYQZHCCC) for details on using the API endpoints.
6. Customize the code to work with your dataset and desired stocks or indices.
